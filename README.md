# redrop

Self-hosted sharing for agent-produced artifacts: HTML pages, files, and static
sites behind private links that can expire, need a password, or work only once.
A Go server (Fuego), a React dashboard (Effect v4 + shadcn/ui), and a
cross-platform CLI that agents drive.

- Every artifact is served from its own origin (`https://<slug>.<content-domain>/`)
  on a domain separate from the dashboard, so shared HTML/JS is isolated.
- Links are unguessable, never indexed, and send no Referer.
- Optional password and view limit. One-time links show an "Open" page first, so
  chat link previews don't use them up. Same-link versions with rollback.
- Multi-user and invite-only; built-in login with TOTP, plus OIDC single sign-on.
- HTML pages get a small info button showing viewers the version, expiry
  countdown, and remaining views, but never who shared the page. Turn it off
  per artifact (`--no-info`, or in the dashboard settings), or for one load
  with `?redrop-info=0`.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `cmd/redrop-server` | Server entrypoint and admin subcommands (`invite`, `reset`, `openapi`) |
| `cmd/redrop` | CLI (`redrop share`, `update`, `list`, `guide`, ...) |
| `pkg/api`, `pkg/client` | Wire types and the Go client library used by the CLI |
| `internal/accounts`, `internal/sharing` | Services holding the business rules |
| `internal/httpapi`, `internal/content` | HTTP transports for the API and artifact domains |
| `internal/store`, `internal/blob` | SQLite persistence and content-addressed file storage |
| `web/` | Dashboard, built into `internal/webui/dist` and embedded in the server |
| `scripts/` | Dev server and end-to-end test |

## CLI

When you create an API token on the dashboard's Tokens page, it shows a
one-line command that installs the CLI and logs it in with that token:

```sh
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://redrop.example.com/install.sh | REDROP_TOKEN='rdp_…' sh
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:REDROP_TOKEN='rdp_…'; irm https://redrop.example.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

The command contains the token, so it ends up in your shell history. To avoid
that, run the installer without `REDROP_TOKEN`, then
`redrop login --url https://redrop.example.com` and paste the token at the
prompt. `redrop guide` explains everything else.

## Develop

Requires Go 1.26 and Node 24.

```sh
cd web && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..   # dashboard into the embed dir
go test ./...
./scripts/dev-server.sh                        # LAN dev server (see the script header)
```

On first start the server logs a one-time setup link for the admin account.
`scripts/e2e.sh` exercises the server and CLI end to end against the dev server.

Frontend checks: `cd web && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`.
`npm run check:contract` verifies the Effect schemas against a running server.

## Configure

All settings are `REDROP_*` environment variables, loaded in
[`internal/config/config.go`](internal/config/config.go). The essentials:

| Variable | Example |
|---|---|
| `REDROP_PUBLIC_URL` | `https://redrop.example.com` (dashboard and API) |
| `REDROP_CONTENT_URL` | `https://usercontent.example` (a separate registrable domain) |
| `REDROP_DATA_DIR` | `/data` |
| `REDROP_OIDC_PROVIDERS`, `REDROP_OIDC_<ID>_ISSUER`, `_CLIENT_ID`, `_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` | optional single sign-on |
| `REDROP_TRUSTED_PROXIES`, `REDROP_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` | client IPs behind a reverse proxy |
| `REDROP_INFO_BUTTON_DEFAULT` | `true` (default): show the viewer info button on artifacts without their own setting |

Status: in development, not yet released.
