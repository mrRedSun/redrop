# redrop design

redrop is a self-hosted server for sharing agent-produced artifacts (HTML/React
pages, arbitrary files, and multi-file static bundles) through unguessable,
expiring, optionally password-protected or view-limited links, with a React
management dashboard and a cross-platform CLI that agents drive.

## Decisions

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Backend | Go, [Fuego](https://github.com/go-fuego/fuego) (OpenAPI generated from code), SQLite (pure Go, no CGO) |
| Dashboard | React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, embedded in the server binary |
| Content | `html` (single page), `file` (any file, inline viewer or download), `bundle` (static site / directory) |
| Accounts | Multiple users, invite-only, roles `admin` and `user` |
| Admin privacy | Admins see other users' artifact metadata (title, size, views, expiry) and can revoke/delete for abuse, but cannot preview content |
| Dashboard login | Built-in username + password (argon2id) with optional TOTP, and generic OIDC (e.g. Authelia). Optionally admin actions require an OIDC-authenticated session |
| Agent auth | Per-user named API tokens (`rdp_…`), shown once, stored as SHA-256 |
| Expiry | Default 7 days; `never` allowed (both configurable; max TTL configurable) |
| Access | Unguessable link; optional password; optional max views (1 = one-time) |
| Versions | Same link, version history, rollback |
| Encryption at rest | None (rely on host isolation) |
| Limits | 500 MB per version, 50 GB server total, 10 GB default per-user quota |
| Agent integration | CLI with thorough `--help`, `redrop guide`, `--json` output; no MCP server |

## Domains and isolation

Two separately configured origins:

* **App origin** (`REDROP_PUBLIC_URL`, e.g. `https://redrop.example.com`): dashboard,
  JSON API, OIDC callbacks, install scripts and CLI downloads.
* **Content domain** (`REDROP_CONTENT_URL`, e.g. `https://usercontent.example`): every
  artifact is served from its own subdomain `https://<slug>.usercontent.example/`. The
  apex serves only a landing page, `robots.txt`, and install scripts.

The content domain must be a different registrable domain from the app origin
so untrusted HTML can never be same-site with the dashboard or other services
(cookie tossing, same-site CSRF, Safe Browsing blast radius). Per-artifact
subdomains give each artifact its own browser origin, so artifacts cannot read
each other's storage, cookies, or service workers, while still allowing normal
`localStorage`/`fetch` inside one artifact.

The slug is 26 lowercase base32 characters (130 random bits) and is the access
secret. "Rotate link" replaces the slug; the artifact ID used by the API/CLI
is stable. Artifact slugs appear in TLS SNI and DNS lookups; that is accepted.

## Content serving rules

Every content response sets:

* `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet, noimageindex`, and
  `/robots.txt` disallows everything.
* `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` so the secret subdomain is not leaked to third
  party CDNs the artifact loads.
* `Cache-Control: private, no-cache` (Cloudflare will not cache, so revocation,
  expiry and view limits are immediate) plus a strong ETag.
* `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors`
  limited to the app origin (dashboard preview), restrictive
  `Permissions-Policy`.

Paths under `/__redrop/` are reserved for gate pages and cannot be uploaded.

### Gates and view counting

* **No password, no view limit:** served directly. A human document navigation
  without a recent `rd_seen` cookie counts as one view. Known link-preview bots
  are recorded as previews, not views.
* **Password and/or max views:** any request without a valid signed access
  cookie gets a neutral interstitial page (no title/metadata leak, noindex).
  Pressing *Open* (and entering the password if set) atomically consumes a view
  and sets a host-only, HttpOnly access cookie for a visit window (1 h for
  view-limited links, 12 h for password-only links) so the page can load its
  assets and be reloaded. Link-preview fetchers never press *Open*, so they do
  not burn one-time links.
* Changing the password, rotating the link, or revoking bumps an access
  generation number that invalidates every outstanding access cookie.
* Password attempts are rate limited per client IP and per artifact; failures
  are recorded in the view log.
* Owners preview through a short-lived signed preview URL created from the
  dashboard; previews never count as views and bypass gates.

### Lifecycle

* `active` → `expired` (TTL elapsed) or `exhausted` (max views reached) or
  `revoked` (manually, reversible).
* Expired artifacts keep content for `REDROP_EXPIRED_RETENTION` (default 72 h)
  so they can be extended/revived, then are deleted. Exhausted artifacts are
  deleted after the visit window ends. Deletion is immediate when requested.
* Blobs are content-addressed (SHA-256) and reference counted, so versions and
  identical files are deduplicated on disk. Quota counts logical bytes of all
  retained versions.

## Uploads

Cloudflare's free plan rejects request bodies over 100 MB, so uploads are
chunked and resumable:

1. `POST /api/v1/uploads {size}` → `{id, chunk_size}` (32 MiB chunks).
2. `PUT /api/v1/uploads/{id}?offset=N` with raw bytes, sequentially; on a
   mismatch the server answers 409 with the received offset so clients resume.
3. `POST /api/v1/artifacts` or `/api/v1/artifacts/{id}/versions` with
   `{upload_id, sha256, kind, …}` finalizes; the server verifies the SHA-256.

Bundles are uploaded as `tar.gz`. Extraction rejects absolute paths, `..`,
links, devices, reserved paths, and enforces file-count and decompressed-size
limits.

## Auth details

* Sessions: random 32-byte token in a `__Host-` cookie (Secure, HttpOnly,
  SameSite=Lax), stored hashed, 30-day lifetime.
* Cookie-authenticated mutating API calls require the `X-Redrop-Request: 1`
  header and a same-origin `Sec-Fetch-Site`/`Origin`, so cross-site requests
  are rejected (CSRF).
* API tokens may only manage the owner's uploads and artifacts and read `/me`;
  account, token and admin endpoints require a dashboard session.
* First start with no users prints a one-time setup URL to the log. Users join
  through admin-created invite links (optionally via OIDC). Forgotten passwords
  are reset with an admin-created reset link; no email is required.
* OIDC providers are configured by environment; identities are linked
  explicitly from the account page or by accepting an invite through OIDC.
  Accounts are never auto-linked by email address.

## CLI

`redrop` is a single static Go binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows (amd64 and
arm64). The server embeds all builds and serves `install.sh`/`install.ps1`, so
`curl -fsSL https://<app>/install.sh | sh` installs a version matching the
server and verifies SHA-256 checksums. Configuration is
`redrop login --url … --token …` or the `REDROP_URL`/`REDROP_TOKEN`
environment variables. Setting `REDROP_TOKEN` for the installer
(`curl … | REDROP_TOKEN=… sh`) also logs in; the dashboard shows that one-line
command when a token is created. Every command supports `--json`; exit codes are stable
(see `redrop guide`). The Go package `pkg/client` is the same client as a library.
